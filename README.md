 My simple digital Calcutor
 My First Digital Calculator Project 🧮

Hello GitHub community! 👋 I'm thrilled to share my first coding project—a digital calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🚀

The Journey
I was inspired by everyday technology and decided to create a digital calculator from scratch. Here's what I used:

HTML: Structured the calculator's interface.

CSS: Made it visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript: Powering the calculator's functionality.

Features
Here are some highlights:

Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear Options: Includes clear and all-clear (C/AC) buttons.

Decimal Support: Handles decimal numbers smartly.

Real-Time Updates: The display updates as you input numbers and operations.

Error Handling: Prevents invalid inputs and gives feedback on errors.

Challenges
The journey had its challenges, like debugging and responsive design. But each hurdle taught me something valuable.

What's Next?
This is just the beginning. I'm already planning my next project, eager to learn and grow.
